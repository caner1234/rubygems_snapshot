Here are development dependencies to help to improve Snapshot.

Use "rake -T" to see the available tasks.

I highly recomend using "RVM":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ during development.

Anything, questions, suggestions etc., send me message or leave an "issue":https://github.com/rogerleite/rubygems_snapshot/issues.

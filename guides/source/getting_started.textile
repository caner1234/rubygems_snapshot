h2. Getting Started

*Export* and *Import* your gems.

Snapshot, copy your current gems in a single file, providing a fast and secure way to import your gems anywhere.

h3. How it Works?

It’s very simple.

When *exporting*, get all gems (like “gem list”) and puts in a yml file.
If gem file exists at cache folder from rubygems, copy to tar file too. (tar format)

When *importing*, copy all gems to rubygems cache folder.
Read the yml file, install the gem file from cache folder or do a simple “gem install” if gem file does not exists.


h3. Install

<shell>
gem install rubygems_snapshot
</shell>

h3. Usage

To export your gems:
<shell>
gem snapshot export gems.tar
</shell>

To import (and install) gems:
<shell>
gem snapshot import gems.tar
</shell>

IMPORTANT: When importing, don’t forget to use *sudo if necessary*. Pay attention to errors relative to *native build*. I don’t know how to deal with that yet! :X

h4. Other Formats

Nowadays, it supports two formats:
* tar (default)
* yml

You can chose the format, using -f parameter. For example:

<shell>
gem snapshot export gems.yml -f yml
gem snapshot import gems.yml -f yml
</shell>
